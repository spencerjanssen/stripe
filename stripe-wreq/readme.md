This package helps you make requests to the [Stripe] API in conjunction with the
[wreq] package. This is a minimal library that makes no attempt obscure either
its underpinnings in Wreq or any of the details of the Stripe API. Responses are
returned as [aeson] values.

  [wreq]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq
